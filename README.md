A Smart Lighting System is lighting technology for smart homes that are connected to internet. These smart lights can make decision, follow schedules and can be controlled remotely using mobiles. It can also be controlled using voice activated personal assistants. Most of these smart light systems come with various different features, possibilities are huge such as changing light colors or reminders etc. When you are about to reach home or you have ordered a pizza and pizza guy arrives porch lights should be automatically turned on. So we are trying build such a system which will be remotely controlled to turn on and turn off the smart light bulb through our phone. This will require Wifi connection. A wifi smart bulb can be placed in holder and it can be controlled remotely using your mobile phones.
